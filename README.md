# 🏌️ Breaking 90: Analyzing My Golf Game

Welcome to my personal golf analytics project! As a casual player working toward consistently breaking 90, I wanted to dig into my game with the same data-driven mindset I bring to my career as a data analyst.

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project analyzes rounds of golf I've played, identifying trends, strengths, and areas for improvement through SQL, R, and Tableau.

- **SQL**: Data structuring and aggregation

- How do FIR, GIR, and putts impact my overall score?
